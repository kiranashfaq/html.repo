     <h1><strong>The Story in the Book</strong></h2>
      <h2><strong>Chapter 1 </strong></h2>
      <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now,On her desk.lying between the copies of <em>Nature,New Scientist, </em>and all the other
    <br />
      scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em> On The Road.</em>It hadf been <strong>M</strong>olly's favourite book since college, and the longer 
       she <br />
       spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

</p>
  <p> She had spent the last ten years in tis room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar  <strong>W</strong>ilde quote proclaiming that "<strong>W</strong>ork is the refuge of people who have
   <br />
     nothing better to do" . Althought many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <strong>DNA,</strong>
      to be an outstanding achievement, 
     <strong>M</strong>olly <br />
     <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
